        <h3>About my Wildlife Nature</h3>
        <p>
            A quite secluded life in the country, with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is to do
            good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then
            rest, nature, books, music, love for ones neighbour-such in my idea of happiness.

        <h4>The Beauty of Nature</h4>
        <p>
            Great lenghts of mountains, thriving ecosystems, the ever-spreading sky together with the lithosphere,
            hydrosphere and atmosphere create a saga called "Nature". Rich both in terms of its scenic beauty and
            replenishing resources, nature accounts for supporting life in different shapes and forms on our planet.
